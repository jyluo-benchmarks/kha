## What is Kha?
Kha is *yet another* Home Automation solution.

## Why Kha?
The main motivation is that most commercial and OSS solutions for Home Automation do gather data and report it most of the time as-is or with basic data computations.

Let's take a simple example to illustrate that.
What matters is not really to see how the temperature in your room changed within the day, but to link that information to the power consumption of your heaters within the same room. But why not something even a bit more elaborated: this information should be used with the outside temperature, that way the heater could be started or stopped at appropriate times.

Kha aims to provide *intelligence* in Home Automation in order to *adapt* to changes, *learn* from real usage and *anticipate* needs.

## Status of the Project
